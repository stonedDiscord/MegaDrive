# MegaDrive
An Open-Source HardWare (OSHW) recreation of the Sega Mega Drive

The design tries to be a 1:1 recreation of the original IC BD M5 PAL board.

## Some of the planned Changes and improvements
- [ ] Verify component values
- [ ] S-Video out

## Tips if you decide to make this/get it made
I've compared prices using https://pcbshopper.com/ and last time I checked JLCPCB had the best prices.
This will vary depending on where it's shipped to. The dimensions are 240x191mm.

If you decide to get it assembled I suggest only getting the bottom side with all the SMD components done and doing the top yourself.
The bottom only has jellybean capacitors and resistors, so it's not going to be very expensive.
I suggest going over the BOM with a text editor to replace all the 0805 component sizes with 0603.
JLCPCB seems to be fading out 0805 resistors out of their "standard components", so this will save you some money.

For the top you will have to salvage at least the 2 video chips.

## Roadmap:
Look at the changes in the other revisions.
