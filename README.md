# MegaDrive
An Open-Source HardWare (OSHW) recreation of the Sega Mega Drive

The design tries to be a 1:1 recreation of the original IC BD M5 PAL board.

## Some of the planned Changes and improvements
- [ ] Verify component values
- [ ] S-Video out

## Tips if you decide to make this/get it made
The dimensions are 240x191mm.

You will have to source the 2 SEGA custom chips from either a dead board or a chip dealer.

## Roadmap:
Look at the changes in the other revisions.
