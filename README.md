# MegaDrive
An Open-Source HardWare (OSHW) recreation of the Sega Mega Drive

The design tries to be a 1:1 recreation of the original IC BD M5 PAL board.

## Some of the planned Changes and improvements
- [ ] Verify component values
- [ ] S-Video out

## Tips if you decide to make this/get it made
The dimensions are 240x191mm.

If you decide to get it assembled I suggest only getting the bottom side with all the SMD components done and doing the top yourself.
The bottom only has jellybean capacitors and resistors, so it's not going to be very expensive.

For the top you will have to salvage at least the 2 video chips.

## Roadmap:
Look at the changes in the other revisions.
